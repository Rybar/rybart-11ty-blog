Finally doing something at rybart.net after 5+ years of sitting on the domain name. 

## What is this?

Who writes a blog in 2022?  Me I guess. I want to document my journey as a creative developer and what I learn along the way. I also want to share my traditional art in a format that isn't social media and is more IndieWeb friendly.

## What to expect

Art posts, musings, maybe some game dev related stuff.  I'm not sure yet.  I'm just going to start writing and see where it goes.

``` javascript
// this is a command
function makeBlog() {
	  console.log('hello world');	
}

// A code block test
console.log('Test');
```
